# Michael Blaskey Introduction Page
I am passionate about technology and am on a lifelong journey to learn and explore.

While having hands-on experience in most of the SDLC / full-stack roles, I keep coming back to my roots as a Dev. I am fulfilled when performing software engineering - designing solutions then building the solution.  I take great pride and am fulfilled when I witness others using the solutions I build - hopefully making a portion of their day / life easier.

Most recently I dove headstrong into C++ (C was the second language I learned).  These are a few tools that have made my life easier and may make your life a bit easier too.  
I use the [**JUCE**](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) framework for the GUI.  Enjoy.

**pwHashMe** validates file hash codes.  I was shocked at how many devs didn't realize they should be checking the checksum hash codes of files they download before decompressing

**pwPassword** is a password keeper.  When I dove into C++, this was the initial project.  It is fully functional, but my backlog is long as there is both user functionality and refactoring to be done based on my continued learning experiences.

**pwAboutMyComputer** is a simple dev tool to view the hardware one is using as well as the environment (paths, variables, etc.)
