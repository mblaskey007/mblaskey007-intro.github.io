# Michael Blaskey Introduction Page
I am passionate about technology and am on a lifelong journey to learn and explore.

While having hands-on experience in most of the SDLC / full-stack roles, I keep coming back to my roots as a Dev. I am fulfilled when performing software engineering - designing solutions then building the solution.  I take great pride and am fulfilled when I witness others using the solutions I build - hopefully making a portion of their day / life easier.

This is a ***Work In Progress*** since programming is not my full time job.  I'll be uploading the executable for these applications soon, except for the company proprietary apps.

## Objective C / Swift
### inFlightChat
This was created before WiFi was widely deployed across the airlines.  It uses the Multipeer Connectivy to allow passengers that are traveling together but seated apart from one another to chat during a flight.  This is the same technology now used in emergencies when landlines and cell service could be down

### ProfitCalc
A profit calculator that was ported to iOS from my original Blackberry Java ME application to allow salespeople to determine the profit and commission based on their "offering" to customers.  Prior to the digital age, the profit wasn't typically available on site or salespeople looked up the profit / commission on a large printed matrix (often while the customer looked on).

### ResumeApproval
Often recruiters were in the field and unable to perform time sensitive tasks until they returned to the office and physically logged into their computer.  This mobile app authenticated to the main application and allowed individuals in the field to approve tasks so they would move forward in the workflow process.

### WES - Workplace Environment Survey
Automated the risk assessment of a site, while the assessor is on-site rather than having to wait until they returned to the office and entered data into the system.  This is an iPad application that collects the data, dynamically evaluates the responses and based on risk thresholds may present further questions or guide the assessor to look at other areas.  Upon completion presents a risk score and some basic remediation actions.  This application reduced risk and saves and estimated $50M/year 

### JobOrder
While recruiters are leading on-site recruitment efforts, they are often disconnected and have to take contact information, details about and individual, etc. via pen-&-paper, then enter that information into an ATS when back at the office.  This iPad application allows a recruiter to scan a job seeker's resume, converts it to OCR, and does a search against the existing job posting all in the field, real time, within a minute or two.  This was groundbreaking as it was one of the first mobile solutions that also matched full resume to job posting - not just keyword.  Advancing the technology, the search isn't limited to just the "vertical" nature, it searches horizontally based on the skills of the job seeker and offers *your same skills apply to these industries / jobs as well* postings.  

## C++
Most recently I dove headstrong into C++ (C was the second language I learned).  These are a few tools that have made my life easier and may make your life a bit easier too.  
I use the [**JUCE**](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) framework for the GUI.  Enjoy.

### pwHashMe 
Validates file hash codes.  I was shocked at how many devs didn't realize they should be checking the checksum hash codes of files they download before decompressing

### pwPassword
A password keeper.  When I dove into C++, this was the initial project.  It is fully functional, but my backlog is long as there is both user functionality and refactoring to be done based on my continued learning experiences.

### pwAboutMyComputer
A simple dev tool to view the hardware one is using as well as the environment (paths, variables, etc.)

### pwCloudDrive
Within one interface, allow a user to upload to various cloud drives and to move files between cloud drives.  Most importantly, it encrypts the files on the way up, and decrypts them on the way down.  Not that I don't trust my cloud providers ;O, but I want to ensure my files are nice and secure.

## Embedded
Just getting started with C/C++ embedded programming ... more soon
